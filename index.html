            <h2>History of the University</h1>
    <p>Jointly founded by the Nationalists and the Communists in <b>1922</b>, the original cause for the Shanghai University was to nurture leaders for the Chinese revolution. The university contributed a group of influential people to the cause of Chinese liberation and development. The university got discontinued in 1927 as a consequence of the Shanghai Massacre, in which the Nationalists purged all communist-related organizations. In <b>1983</b>, the Chinese government reopened Shanghai University. And then in 1994, by integrating three other universities, it became a research-intensive comprehensive university, and also the biggest higher learning institution run by Shanghai Municipality. The university enrolls 19,934 undergraduate and 16,954 postgraduate students, including 4,505 international students.</p>
